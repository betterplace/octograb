# Github stats

Quick and dirty script to grab some stats from github repos.

To use this you need to [create a github token](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
with the `read:org, read:public_key` and `repo` permissions
(if it is a classic token).



## Usage:
```
./bin/octograb -t <GITHUB_TOKEN> -r betterplace/betterplace
```
